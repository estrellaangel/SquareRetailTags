"""Turning raw gateway telemetry into something a human can act on.

The gateway reports RF power in dBm and a raw battery byte. Neither reads
as "is this label OK?" at a glance, which is what someone walking the
shop floor with a phone actually needs. This module does that one
conversion and nothing else.
